# Missing Error Handling in Express.js POST Request

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: missing error handling for empty or invalid request bodies in POST requests.  The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version.

## Problem

The original code lacks validation and error handling for the incoming request body. If a client sends an empty or malformed request, the application will either log an error or (worse) silently fail.

## Solution

The solution includes validation to check if the request body is present and contains the necessary data. It also handles potential errors with appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages.
